any name followed by ()  is called as functions in python.
but when a function is associated with any obj, it is called method.

for ex: nos=range(10)
        nos.append(), nos.remove() and even user defined are called methods.

 A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other
 object types can have methods as well. For example, list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort,
 and so on.
